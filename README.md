# Website-Example
Want to create your website, but you dont know how to code? Then this repository is for you!

 **Installing Live Preview is Recommended!**

 # Setting

In <title> tag, change to your own. It can be like "My website" or "Game Name". After you change the title, you can see the window name in your browser.

In <style> tag, it's a CSS code. Anything from CSS can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">here</a> . Change styles as you wish. I'm not restricting for it. (please dont really do that bad üôè)

Right there, in a href tag, change the link to your own. **The link should be in double quotes!!**. After the brackets - <> change the text to anything you want. It can be "Oh look a good button, press it!"

In img tag, you'll have to put an image into your folder.

Please understand that website runs on local server! It's hosted by an extension you've installed earlier!
